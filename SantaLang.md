## Introduction
Dear Julius, Santa knows you like playing around with new languages & CTFs. That's why my wonderful elves were busy developing a new language, especially for you! In this language you could solve a nice little CTF.

The problem is: my lead elvelopment elvineer has disappeared, so we have a half finished language, but without documentation! So unfortunately, I can only provide you with the interpreter, an Intellij plugin for some highlighting, and the CTF. After solving this CTF I can finally unlock my safe which contains my present for you.

### CTF
So, first install the Intellij plugin and open the `.santa` file provided to you. This file contains the CTF, which requires a correct input, right now it is "nacht", but unfortunately this is not the right key, so it is of utmost importance you provide me with the right key as soon as possible!

You can run the interpreter by just calling the executable with the filename as argument, like this: `./santalang ctf.santa`. If it outputs "You saved santa" you found my key!

I hope you can help my find the key to unlock your present. If you have questions, you know how to contact me :)

Best regards,

Santa
